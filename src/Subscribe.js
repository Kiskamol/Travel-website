From the majestic five-star hotels in Bangkok to simple beach huts in Koh Samui or Koh Samet, accommodation choices are many. From the stunning plains and hills of the Golden Triangle to the wave-lapped white sand beaches of Phuket, Samui and Krabi, the kingdom radiates beauty. Thailand has so much to offer that one visit is never enough â€“ you'll want to come back and discover more time after time.`,
